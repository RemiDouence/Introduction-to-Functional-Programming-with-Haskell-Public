# Introduction to Functional Programming with Haskell

Here is the material for my course at IMT Atlantique about
introduction to functional programming with Haskell.

## FIL software engineering apprenticeship program

(http://www.imt-atlantique.fr/formation/ingenieur-par-apprentissage/ingenieurs-specialite-ingenierie-logicielle). This
3-year program leads to a Master's degree in software engineering at
IMT Atlantique.

About 30 students each year.

Half a day block = I program in front of the students for 75 minutes, then the students get my code and complete it for 150 minutes.
There are 5 blocks. 
I evaluate the last (5th) block.
Total time = 17h30.
